# pgpnet

This repo contains a handful of scripts I use to automate a number of tasks for the PGPNET mailing list.  None meet my professional standards for code: “it works for me” is the best which can be said for them.  But if they’re useful to you, have at them.

## Licensing

All scripts are released under terms of the ISC License.  Share and enjoy.

## update_prr

This updates keyrings and Enigmail’s per-recipients rule automagically.  Much easier than maintaining them by hand.  Note that you may need to restart Thunderbird to force it to reload the per-recipient rules.
